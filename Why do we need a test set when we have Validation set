#Why on the earth, do we need a test set, when we have the Validation set?

When we go to test the model; using the test set, it looks at the data that it has **truly** never seen before.
Though, during the training process, the model is not using the data in the validation set to update its weights, but the model selection process,
is based on how the models perform with the Validation data. So, there is a finite possiblity that, the model hence selected is biased towards the Validation set.
That is why, we need third set,  the Test set, to truly see how our model generalizes, and performs when given some data it has truly never sen before.
