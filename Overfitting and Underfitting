# Underfitting
It can be understood with an example of like--- 

We are trying to kill a Godzilla with a flyswatter. Technically, it is also termed as *Error due to Bias*

#Overfitting
This is the case when the model becomes too specific to the given data, and it falis to generalize. Its like trying to kill a mosquito with a gun.
Technically, its referred to as error due to varience.

This can be also understood as, say, we are preparing for exams. Overfitting is we memeorize everything written in the textbook without understanding anything.
Underfitting is studying very less. The best model is to study the textbooks and understand the concepts and hence generalize the knowledge. 
Though the overfitted student can answer anything that is asked from the textbook, but nothing ou of the questions mentioned in the book.
